# Fall Guin - Interactive Unity 3D Game Development

## Overview

This repository contains **Fall Guin**, an interactive 3D game developed in Unity for the Year 2 G6078: Game Design and Development Assignment 1 - Interactive 3D Game Development in Unity 3D, completed in October 2024. This project was a group effort, showcasing collaborative skills and various technical proficiencies.

**Note:** This is a group project. While contributions were made by me, the work represents a collaborative effort.

## Game Description

**Fall Guin** draws inspiration from "Fall Guys". Players control Pingu, navigating through an Arctic-themed obstacle course, collecting fish, and overcoming challenges to reach the goal.
